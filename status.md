Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I have found a few libraries that I can use for my project. They are "requests", "flask", and "gtfs_kit". Flask is for making a simple hhtp server and requests allows you to get info from the internet over http.  I created three modules two of which are executables. One executable has the cli code and the other is a server. And then the third module is a library. I also wrote a function that can download a URL (a GTFS file) and then unzip it.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I haven't made the actual website yet or finished the rest of what I need to code such as reading the GTFS file and asking the user what date and line/station they want to view a timetable for.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

I got a concussion which has made it very difficult for me to do work for a while. I'm still dealing with lingering symptoms such as difficulty concentrating, difficulty remembering, and occasional headaches.
