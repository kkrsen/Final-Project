# Final-Project

Final project for my Intro to Problem Solving and Programming in Python class CIS 1051 Spring 2024

I'd say the most challenging thing for me was that I had very little time to
complete this project since I couldn't work on it for a while because of my
concussion. Despite that, I think that I still managed to do very well on my
project and I'm incredibly proud of myself. There were a lot of new things
I had to learn. It was difficult, interesting, and fun. The main thing I had to
learn was probably just how all this stuff is set up. I also had to learn how
to use HTML and the Jinja language to make a website! I think it's pretty cool that I
made a website that actually functions. When I didn't know how to do something, I
would use the internet as a resource or ask those around me who know coding to see if
they could put me on the right track. I figured out how to make the text on
my website different colors depending on the train line color. I realized
that using for loops and variables in Jinja can be kind of confusing, but with more
practice, I started to understand it better. I would also sometimes get an error
message and it was just because I forgot to go to my server.py to make sure I passed
the variable through. Overall, I'm surprised at how much I was able to get
done in about a week and a half, and amazed at how much I was able to learn in
that short amount of time.

There are three things in my project that I wasn't able to get to finish. The first
is that the selection of a train station doesn't work because I ran out of time
to code that. I was only able to code the train lines. The second thing is that
people aren't able to choose a specific date for what they want to view. It's
currently set up so that the date will be whatever day it is that day. This makes
it so that urls that are of old GTFS files won't work to display a timetable. You
will be able to view a list of all the lines and stations, you just won't be able
to select one. The last things is that the user can't download a PDF of the
timetable at the end. These are the three things that I would have liked to finish
if there was more time. I would also like to make the website look aesthetically
better.
